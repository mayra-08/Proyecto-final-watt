    My name is Mayra Julissa Cortes Gomez and my nickname is juli o flaca. I am 22 years old , I am single and I don't have children. I was born in San Jose,Costa Rica, october 08 of 1998.About my religion I believe honestly in God . Actually, I live in la carpio,san jose  with my parents and siblings. My parents are from Nicaragua and my siblings and I are Costa rican. I have 4 brothers and one sister, some of them are studying and others are working.
    I finished my studies at the high school jose fidel tristan located in San jose city, when I was 16 years old in 2015 and then ,in 2017 I got an english technician with an emphasis on customer service:
    Work experience, when I was 17 years old my first job was in a warehouse where they sell all kinds of products and accessories. Then at 18 years old I worked in a company Unibebidas for 1 year and the following year I worked in another store in customer service.lo that after having been in that job, the pandemic entered the covid-19 and now I am only studying.
    Currently I am a student and  I am a participant of the Actim Zones program. In that program, I'm studying english and technology . I have been studying  and in the program for one year. This program has been a great opportunity for me, where I learned and developed new skills like a Microsoft office (excel,power-point,word) At INA.
Besides I received soft skills and digital skills courses that I finished successfully.
<div id="textobiografia">
 <p> In that program I realized a community project with some friends so my community project is  making educational and instructive videos and  show improvements and evolution of  our community Carpio,  idea was born for helping parents,children for educate in differents areas in their lives, then upload it to a social page specially for our community called (Carpio por un futuro mejor )  and share with our community because the main idea is to help them in this times of pandemic.
 A little about me:  I am an easy-going and honest person, also i´m friendly,talkative and kind. I am a girl that loves to dance and read romantic books. Also, I am interested in learning english and finding a good job soon. Also, I am interested in writing my own book about myself because I would like to support young people with my story , so I think that write a book is my biggest dream and I believe that someday i´ll achieve it with God's help.   
Regarding my preferences and hobbies  I like to learn new things every day and every moment,I like to eat fast food,I really enjoy listening to music so this is one of my favorite hobbies, also I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. That is my favorite hobby too.
On the other hand  I hate to spend time taking naps because while other people are spending time taking naps , I can to be reading books,articles,exploring new things
. 
My goal is being a great and professional woman with a positive attitude and strong spirit.For this reason at this moment I am working very hard and with much dedication, working everyday in my strengths and weaknesses.
