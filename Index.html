<h2>What did I learn about this course?</h2>
<p>
    In this course ,I learned many things but especially how I can face the unknown and said I can do it. Introduction to web it was not only other experience, it was a great, 
    a rewarding and a unforgettable experience where i started  without any knowledge and now  I can make a web page, In this course I learned how to create a structure in HTML “base” by marking labels and how to give life to the page with CSS and make it more attractive with JAVASCRIPT. Also, how to manipulate different applications for instance github,visual studio apart to be a little complicated. Besides I learned from concepts and how to open tags in HTML to methods and strategies, how to manipulate the page, insert colors, icons, titles, images, move the content, center the content, size different elements on the page, among other styles with CSS, give functionality with JAVASCRIPT among many other things.I learned how to use it and know what its function is . 
    In my opinion this course  wasn't easy , so I took it as a challenge and now I am happy with my results. Every Saturday of this course it  was interesting and very productive.
    Thanks to this course ,I have the opportunity to learn many things,and made me want to continue studying it and acquire more knowledge.
     I really learned a lot, because when I started the fears of not being able to understand anything were present but as I entered the subject and began to learn my fears were gone and today I can say that I managed to learn a lot.
